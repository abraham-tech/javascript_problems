# Card Game

This project is a simple card game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where a player competes against the computer in a battle of cards. The game involves flipping cards from two decks (one for the player and one for the computer) and comparing their values to determine the winner. The goal is to deplete the opponent's deck to win the game.
